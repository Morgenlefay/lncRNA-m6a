# lncRNA-m6a
Predict m6A sites in lncRNA
LITHOPHONE, which stands for long noncoding RNA methylation site prediction from sequence characteristics and genomic information with an ensemble predictor. We show that the methylation sites of lncRNA and mRNA have different patterns exhibited in the extracted features and should be differently handled when making predictions. Due to the used experiment protocols, the number of known lncRNA m6A sites is limited and insufficient to train a reliable predictor; thus, the performance can be improved by combining both lncRNA and mRNA data using an ensemble predictor.
